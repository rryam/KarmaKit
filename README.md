# KarmaKit

KarmaKit is a Swift library inspired by [Hugging Face’s smolagents](https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents), designed to make building agentic systems simple. 

The name “Karma” comes from the Sanskrit word कर्म (karma), which means “action” or “deed,” perfectly captures the purpose of this library: enable intelligent, action-driven AI agents with minimal setup.

KarmaKit is currently under development, so stay tuned for updates!
